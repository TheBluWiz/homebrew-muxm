  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      muxm is installed. To complete setup, run:

        muxm --install-completions    # bash/zsh tab completion

      Optional dependencies (install as needed):

        brew install dovi_tool         # Dolby Vision RPU handling
        brew install gpac              # DV container signaling (MP4Box)
        brew install tesseract         # PGS subtitle OCR

      For subtitle burn-in (--sub-burn-forced), ffmpeg must be built with
      libass. If you need this feature:

        brew tap homebrew-ffmpeg/ffmpeg
        brew install homebrew-ffmpeg/ffmpeg/ffmpeg --with-libass
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "MuxMaster v#{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/muxm --version")
  end
end
